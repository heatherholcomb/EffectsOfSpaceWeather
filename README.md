# EffectsOfSpaceWeather
## High Level Description
#### Space Weather describes the variations in the space environment between the sun and earth. In particular, Space Weather describes the phenomena that impact systems and technologies in orbit and on Earth. Space Weather can occur anywhere from the surface of the sun to the surface of the earth. 
## Space Weather Data
#### Space Weather Data was taken from: https://celestrak.com/
#### The Space Weather Data was cleaned ahead of time, meaning there was a header in the file used and it was faster to remove the header and load the data rather than attempt to remove the header through python. 
#### Data Time Frame: The space weather data contains data ranging from 1957-2020

#### A description of these data fields can be found here: https://celestrak.com/SpaceData/SpaceWx-format.php
#### Note that the columns shown in the image have been renamed from the original dataset. 

## Climate
#### Climate Data was taken from: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/
#### Data Description: The climate data used for this project includes monthly climate data ranging from 01/01/2000 - 12/31/2019 and contains weather data from 5 different weather stations including:
#### -London Corbin Airport, KY
#### -Jerome CO Airport, ID
#### -Salina Municipal Airport, KS
#### -Greenville Main Forestry Service, ME
#### -Annapolis NAF, MD
#### The climate data used for this project contains the following columns:
