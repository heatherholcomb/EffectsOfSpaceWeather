# EffectsOfSpaceWeather
## High Level Description
##### Space Weather describes the variations in the space environment between the sun and earth. In particular, Space Weather describes the phenomena that impact systems and technologies in orbit and on Earth. Space Weather can occur anywhere from the surface of the sun to the surface of the earth. 
##### Different aspects of space weather can affect multiple systems here on earth such as GPS, Climate, Radio and Satellite Communication. Solar flares can affect radio waves, solar energetic particles can cause electrical failure in satellites and block radio communications, geomagnetic storms can modify systems from GPS, when cosmic rays are high it can create nucleation in the atmosphere and produce more cloudy conditions and solar irradiance can have an affect on climate as well. 
##### The questions i would like to answer with this project include:  
###### - How does the Kp Index, or geomagnetic activity effect climate? 
###### - How does the F10.7 index effect climate? 
###### - How does Ap - Planetary Equivalent Amplitude effect climate? 
###### - How does Cp - Planetary Daily Character Figure effect climate? 
###### - How does ISN - International Sunspot Number effect climate? 
###### - Can I predict space weather using historical data? 

## Kp Index 
### Description of Kp Index: 
#### The Kp-index is the global geomaagnetic activity index that is based on 3-hour measuremetns from ground-based magnetometers around the world. The value being used for the models described below is the Sum of the 8 Kp indices for the day expressed to the nearest third of a unit.
#### Simple Linear Regression model - How does the Kp index affect Wind?

## F10.7
### Description of F10.7: 
#### The F10.7 Index is a measure of the noise level generated by the sun at a wavelength of 10.7 cm at the earth's orbit. this index has been used as an input to ionospheric models as a surrogate for the solar output in wavelengths that produce photoionization in the earth's ionosphere (in the ultraviolet bands).

## Ap 
### Description of Ap Index 
#### The Ap-index provides a daily average level for geomagnetic activity. Because of the non-linear relationship of the K-scale to magnetometer fluctuations, it is not meaningful to take the average of a set of K-indices. Instead, every 3-hour K-value will be converted back into a linear scale called the a-index. The average from 8 daily a-values gives us the Ap-index of a certain day. The Ap-index is thus a geomagnetic activity index where days with high levels of geomagnetic activity have a higher daily Ap-value.

## Cp
### Description of Cp Index 
#### 

## ISN - International Sunspot Number
